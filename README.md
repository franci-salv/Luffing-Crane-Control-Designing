Dynamics and Control of a Luffing Crane (2025-2026 Challenge)This project details the comprehensive modeling and control system design for a Luffing Crane, focusing on managing load sway in a 2D environment1111. The objective is to precisely control the x-position of the load ($x_l$) using an actuator force ($F_A$) applied to the hoist block2222.🏗️ System DescriptionThe crane system is modeled in two dimensions and consists of several key components:Crane Beam: A rigid rod of length $L_0$3.Jib: A rigid rod of length $L_1$ attached to the crane beam4.Hoist Block: A point mass ($m_2$) that moves along the jib5555.Load: A point mass ($m_3$) suspended by a chain of length $L_2$6666.Generalized CoordinatesThe system's dynamics are described by the generalized coordinates7:$$\underline{q}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} x(t) \\ \theta(t) \end{bmatrix}$$Where:$x(t)$ is the position of the hoist block8.$\theta(t)$ is the absolute angle of the chain9.🛠️ Technical Workflow1. Dynamics & ModelingNon-linear Equations of Motion (EoMs): Derived using the Lagrange method based on kinetic energy, potential energy, and non-conservative forces10101010.Linearization: The EoMs were linearized around stable equilibrium positions to analyze small-signal behavior11111111.Transfer Functions: Developed the plant transfer function $G(s)$ relating input force $F_A$ to load displacement $y(s) = x_l(s)$12121212.Plant TF: $G(s) = \frac{5.1 \cdot 10^{-3}s^2 + 10s + 250}{5 \cdot 10^5s^4 + 2.5 \cdot 10^5s^3 + 6.4 \cdot 10^5s^2 + 4.9 \cdot 10^4s}$13.2. Feedback Control DesignThe project progressed through several control iterations to meet performance requirements141414141414141414:Proportional (P) Control: Evaluated gains $P_1=80$, $P_2=400$, and $P_3=700$ to assess stability and steady-state error15151515.Proportional-Derivative (PD) Control: Implemented $C(s) = 390s + 360$ to improve transient response16.Lead/Lag Filters: Used to refine the open-loop $L(s) = C(s)G(s)$ characteristics for better stability margins171717171717171717.Notch Filtering: Designed a complex controller $C_2(s)$ to suppress resonance frequencies, which act as bandwidth-limiting factors18.Controller Structure:$$C_2(s) = K \frac{\frac{\alpha}{\omega_c}s + 1}{\frac{1}{\alpha\omega_c}s + 1} \cdot \left(\frac{\omega_p}{\omega_z}\right)^2 \frac{s^2 + 2\beta_z\omega_zs + \omega_z^2}{s^2 + 2\beta_p\omega_ps + \omega_p^2}$$193. Analysis & RobustnessFrequency Domain: Used Nyquist contours and Bode plots to determine Phase Margin (PM), Gain Margin (GM), and Modulus Margin (MM)202020202020202020.Parameter Sensitivity: Tested robustness against a 90% decrease in the load damping coefficient $d_W$212121212121212121.Disturbance Rejection: Analyzed the sensitivity function $S(s)$ to evaluate the system's ability to suppress external wind disturbances $d(t)$222222222222222222.💻 Software RequirementsThe following MATLAB toolboxes are required to run the simulations2323:Simulink 24Control Systems Toolbox 25Symbolic Math Toolbox 26Simscape / Simscape Multibody 27📈 Key ResultsSuccessfully stabilized the load position with a maximum allowed overshoot of 30%28.Achieved a crossover frequency of $f_c = 0.06$ Hz using advanced loop-shaping with notch filters29.Verified that the identity $S + T = 1$ holds for the designed closed-loop system, highlighting the trade-off between tracking and noise rejection30.
